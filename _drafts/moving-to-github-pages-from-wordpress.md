## Introduction
I recently moved my personal blog to GitHub Pages from
Wordpress.com. I have been thinking about doing it for
sometime and this time I finally did it. And I wanted to
share a few things about why I did it.

## What are GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages are public static webpages hosted and published through
GitHub. And it is completely free of cost. The source codes of
the website are also hosted in a public repository in GitHub.

## What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator. You write contents in simple
HTML or in Markdown and it creates pages out of it. It uses Liquid,
a simple templating language which makes it very easy to have
custom templates designed for all your pages and when you run
Jekyll, it automatically combines the contents and the templates
and creates the final static pages.

## Why Jekyll?
Although I did not do any extensive comparison between Jekyll and
all other similar solutions, Jekyll did seem the one of the best
solution to start with because
- GitHub Pages have supports for Jekyll out of the box.

## Why did I do it?
### Freedom

### Transparency

### Vim and Markdown

## How did I do it?

## Is it worth it?
Absolutely. Now every time I want to write a new post, I just
need to do this.

    vim
    Write some markdown
    git add
    git commit
    git push

And my new post post is published. Can it get any simpler?
