### Introduction
Although Debian 11 codenamed *Bullseye* was released on
[14h August, 2021](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/), 5 months back,
it was only in January, 2022 that I upgraded all my computers running
Debian 10 to Debian 11.
Admittedly a little late to the party, I like to take a cautious approach to
upgrading the system version, which is not very difficult to predict given my
Linux distribution of choice!
In this post, I am going to share the steps I used while doing the upgrade and
my experience.

### A word of caution
This post should not be considered a guide on how to do Debian upgrades.
The simple reason is that every system is configured differently and there is
no one guide that can cover all types of system configurations.
Except probably the
[Official Debian guide to upgrade from Debian 10](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html)).
This post should give you some practical experience on how to go about it.
But it is strongly suggested that you go through the official upgrade guide
before you actually do the upgrade.
