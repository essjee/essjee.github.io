### Introduction
I am working on a series of opinionated posts on how to get started with the
basics of Kubernetes using Minikube. In this series, I will discuss on a range
of topics starting from installation of Minikube to the deployment of pods and
also fixes to a few annoying issues I faced along the way. This is the first
article in the series where I talk about how to install Minikube in your local
workstation.

### Kubernetes
From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes):

> Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating

Kubernetes is probably the most popular and widely used system for deploying
and managing scalable and highly available applications world wide.
