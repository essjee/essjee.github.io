# Introduction
This is the first post in a series of articles on designing and creating
an **Application Monitoring System**.
An Application Monitoring System (AMS) is a system for monitoring
performance of other running applications. I will build this application
component by component from scratch and publish it here on this blog.
In this article, I talk about creating and running services that provide
application performance metrics using Spring Boot, Spring Actuator and Docker.
