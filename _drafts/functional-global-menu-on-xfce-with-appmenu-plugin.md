### Introduction
So finally after tinkering with it for a while now and having given up on it
once in the past, I finally have got a very much functional global menu working
on my Xfce desktop running on Debian 10.
For those of you who are unaware, global menu is a way of displaying the
application menus on the top of the screen like the way MacOS does.
In this post I will explain the steps I followed to get it configured.

### Conclusion
Having been used to a Mac on my work computer for quite some time now, there
are a few features I liked.
to replicate a few things related to MacOS on my personal laptop.
And the global menu was on top of that list.

IRC is still an excellent protocol for internet messaging.
It may never get its old popularity back but it has not lost all of its
usefulness even in today's age.
Matrix makes chatting over IRC and staying always connected easier than ever.
