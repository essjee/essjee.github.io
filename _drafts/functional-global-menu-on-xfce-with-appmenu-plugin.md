### Introduction
So finally after tinkering with it for a while now
I finally have got a very much functional global menu working
on my Xfce desktop running on Debian 10.
In this post I will explain the steps I followed to get it configured.

### Global menu vs Local menu
For those of you who might be wondering what a *global menu* is, it is a way of
displaying the application menus on the top of the screen like the way MacOS
does.
By default the Xfce desktop displays the menus right below the Window title
bar.

But if you have a small display screen (eg. a laptop display), this may not be
the most efficient use of the vertical screen space.
The MacOS does a better job at this by displaying the application menus
directly on the top panel.

Apart from MacOS, it was most prominently used in the
[Unity DE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)) by Ubuntu.

### Load GTK_MODULES="appmenu-gtk-module"

### Configure the top panel

### Conclusion
Having been used to a Mac on my work computer for quite some time now, there
are a few features I liked.
to replicate a few things related to MacOS on my personal laptop.
And the global menu was on top of that list.
