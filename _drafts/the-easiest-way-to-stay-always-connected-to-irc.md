### Introduction
Connecting to an IRC room may not be a difficult task but if you have a group
of members working from different locations and timezones spanned across the
globe and if you don't want to miss out messages while you are offline, you
may find yourself in a tricky situation.
In this post I am going to discuss about the easiest and the most
cost-effective way to stay always connected to IRC using
[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)).

### Internet Relay Chat
Chances are that if you are reading this post then you already know about
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).
For others, IRC is an old decentralized messaging protocol that used to drive
much of the online group chatting before the era of the more modern chatting
platforms began.
Although the usage of IRC has been in steady decline since 2003, it's heavily
used in many of the open source projects from that era for real-time
communications.

### Why do you need to be always connected?
In today's world of Slack, Teams and Discord, the idea of always being
connected to the servers to not to miss out any messages may seem a little
difficult to grasp at first.
At its core, IRC is a client and server protocol where the server relays a
message to the clients connected to it when the message arrives.
The server does not store any history of the messages.
So when the message arrives, if you are not connected to the server, you lose
the message.
This is why if you want to reliably communicate on IRC, you need a mean to stay
always connected to the server.

### What are the other options available?
If you have a home server that is always connected to the internet or if you
can rent a VM on the cloud, then it is not much of an issue for you provided
the command line does not turn you off.
If it does, you can look into the [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/).
You can think of it as your own cloud IRC client.
After you create an account, you can log into it from any web browser or your
mobile phone and when you log out your client still stays connected.
Although their paid accounts are mostly okayish, their free version suffers
from frequent disconnections.

usefulness even in today's age.
