### Introduction
In one of my older posts, [Creating word documents on the command
line](creating-word-documents-on-the-command-line.html) I have explained how I
prefer writing documents in the markdown syntax and later convert them to PDF
using Pandoc over the use of more popular methods such as using a full featured
office suite.
This method has worked well for me except one niggling thing.
By default Pandoc uses LaTeX as the intermediatory step while converting a
markdown document into PDF.
This is largely invisible to the user
