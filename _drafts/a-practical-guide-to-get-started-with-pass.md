### Introduction
In my recent endeavour to upgrade my digital security, I started using the
[Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/),
the command-line based password manager for my online accounts.
While there were a few online guides that I could find to get started with Pass,
I did have a feeling that a comprehensive guide for new users was missing.
In my attempt to fill the gap, I will try to touch upon various aspects that one
needs to be mindful of to use pass in the most secure and optimal way.

### Why a (dedicated) password manager
The days are over when you remembered the passwords for your online accounts.
In this age virtually for every other service, you need to use an online
account.
And even though many services are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA)
today for securely logging into your accounts, the importance of a strong
password is still as high as ever.
And the best security practice says that the passwords are strongests when they
are as random as possible, something that an average human mind can neither
create nor remember easily.
And this is where the importance of a password manager lies.
It's far easier to rather lock all your keys behind a master lock and have one
very secure key than to carry around separate keys for all the locks with you.

But when in today's age effectively all major browsers provide password storage
and sync features, it may not sound very practical to have separate piece of
software for storing your passwords.
There can be 
[arguments](https://www.howtogeek.com/447345/why-you-shouldnt-use-your-web-browsers-password-manager/)
on both sides but it's generally a more secure practice to use a password
manager to manage your passwords and trust a browser for what it does best -
browse the internet.
