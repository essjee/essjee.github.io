# Introduction
The command line has always seemed to me something that is both fascinating and
under-utilized at the same time to a large extent.
Creating a document on the command line is easy and sometime it is more
straightforward than using WYWIWYS tools like Libreoffice or MS Office or
Google Docs. In this post I share how I use pandoc, vim and markdown for
creating good professional grade documents using nothing but the command line.

# Pandoc
From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc):

> Pandoc is a free and open-source document converter, widely used as a writing
tool and as a basis for publishing workflows.

Basically Pandoc converts one document format to another. It has a large
array of
[supported document types](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/README.md#the-universal-markup-converter)
including markdown, .doc and .pdf.

I will be using Pandoc for converting the raw documents to final
presentable formats.

# Markdown
Markdown is a simple markup language that is easy-to-read and easy-to-write.
It first appeared in 2014 and over the years, it has gain acceptance in the
developer community and is widely used as a tool to write software
documentations and README files.

I will use Markdown for writing the raw document files.

# Vim
[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))
is a fantastic text editor for the command line that needs little introduction.
It has inbuilt support for highlighting multiple languages among other things.
I will be using Vim as an editor for creating the raw documents.
