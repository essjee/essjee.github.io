<p>I have been brushing up my skills in Python from last week. I am a Java developer by profession and my love for Python came purely from a hobby perspective. But nevertheless, love is love. First time I learnt Python when I was still not that into Java and the Python version was 2.x. But this time, I went with the version 3.x.<br />
I am also learning how to make GUI application with PyGObject since PyGtk is not used in new development anymore. This is some amazing work by the developers that I don't have to work in C++ to make GTK+ applications. My next goal is to make my first application in Python and GTK+, albeit a simple one, which I might publish also.</p>
