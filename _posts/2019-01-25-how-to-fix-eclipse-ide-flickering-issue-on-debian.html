<p>I am using Eclipse IDE (version 2018-12 at the time of writing) on Debian 9 Xfce andÂ the issue with it is that the Eclipse editor windows would flicker around the edges. Sometimes so much so that it's impossible to type inside it. Here's how I fixed it:</p>
<p>First check the value of GTK_IM_MODULE in your environment by executing</p>

{% highlight bash %}
echo $GTK_IM_MODULE
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In my case the output was "xim". But Eclipse expect it to be "ibus". So enter the following command in a terminal session to set it to the value.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
export GTK_IM_MODULE="ibus"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now if you launch Eclipse from the same terminal session, you should not experience any flickering issue. If you launch eclipse from a desktop menu entry, then edit the .desktop file and put the following string in the beginning of the Exec command:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
env GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
{% endhighlight %}
